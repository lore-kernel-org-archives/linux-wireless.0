Here are two that I don't see in the list:

 * LVDS downclocking breaks on G45/thinkpad T500

     LKML: http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/12/26/40
     FDO:  http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25809
 
 * Receive failure in et131x (Alan Cox sent me a patch for this but
                              it's not in mainline yet)
