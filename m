So arc4_setup_iv() should do what the internal arc4_ivsetup() does and
we change void to int and check the keysize in there right? The problem
here is that we are bounded to *this* implementation of the algorithm
and are not able to replace it with a different implementation. Not that
this is likely to happen for RC4 but it may be true for other stream
ciphers.

Prior patch #3 it has no test case so it should not test it at all.
Patch #3 adds a flag in order to distinguish it. You want to look at
patch #3 now :)
