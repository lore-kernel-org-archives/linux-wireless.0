Yeah I had a hard time following the changelog, but just looked it
over.  Looks safe, but Justin will still need to check the return value
on pci_reenable_device.

Justin, we don't want a message on every reenable, just on ones that
fail.  So can you protect your printk with if (retval) instead?  You'll
need to refresh it based on my linux-next branch in a few minutes, as
I'm pushing Yinghai's patch now.
