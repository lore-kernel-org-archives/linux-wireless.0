Ok, I get that.  However, we have Documentation/hw_random.txt saying:

  This data is NOT CHECKED by any fitness tests, and could potentially be
  bogus (if the hardware is faulty or has been tampered with).  Data is
  only output if the hardware "has-data" flag is set, but nevertheless a
  security-conscious person would run fitness tests on the data before
  assuming it is truly random.

Which I would read as "Don't assume 1 bit read from /dev/hwrng equals 1
bit of entropy."  Which runs counter to Stephan's reading of the rngd
code.

And then we have drivers like timeriomem-rng.c that appear to be
spitting out the raw 32bit register value of $SOC's timer.

Thankfully, most hw_random drivers don't set the quality.  So unless the
user sets the default_quality param, it's zero.

iiuc, Ted, you're saying using the hw_random framework would be
disasterous because despite most drivers having a default quality of 0,
rngd assumes 1 bit of entropy for every bit read?

thx,

Jason.
