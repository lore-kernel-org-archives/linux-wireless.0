Fair point, but

Usually but not always. There are 3 calls to that function on SCTP
code:
- pack a cookie, which is sent on an INIT_ACK packet to the client
- unpack the cookie above, after it is sent back by the client on a
  COOKIE_ECHO packet
- send a chunk authenticated by a hash

the first two happen during softirq processing, while processing a
packet that was received.

As I explained on the other email, SCTP code is not supposed to store
any information about the peer between the 1st and the 2nd moments
above, to be less vulnerable to DoS attacks (it's planned so by the
RFC), thus why it uses the cookie.

The 3rd one we probably can improve, but I don't think we can do much
about the 2 first ones from the SCTP side.

Note on sctp_sf_do_5_1B_init() how sctp_make_init_ack() is explicitly
called with GFP_ATOMIC, and also on sctp_sf_do_unexpected_init().
Though we can't propagate that to crypto_shash_setkey.

Ideas?

Thanks,
Marcelo
