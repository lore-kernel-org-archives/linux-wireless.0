On a MacBookPro14,3 with a BCM43602 (14e4:43ba, subsystem 106b:0173),
5 GHz stops working once the chip has been reset to its power-on
state, which happens over S3 while running on battery. Scans still
report 5 GHz networks, but every attempt to join one fails: the
firmware ends the join with a SET_SSID event with status
BRCMF_E_STATUS_FAIL and no LINK event, which brcmfmac reports as
WLAN_STATUS_AUTH_TIMEOUT, seen in wpa_supplicant as
"CTRL-EVENT-ASSOC-REJECT ... status_code=16". A 2.4 GHz network could
still be joined in that state. Reloading the driver, power cycling
the slot or a secondary bus reset do not help; only a reboot of the
machine does.

On this board 5 GHz depends on bit 4 of the ChipCommon chipcontrol
register, which Broadcom's sbchipc.h calls
CCTRL4360_DISCRETE_FEMCTRL_MODE (front-end module control through the
discrete FEM control pins). After a reboot the bit is set. brcmfmac
never writes it and firmware 7.35.177.61 does not set it after a
power-on reset, so presumably the platform firmware sets it at boot.
The watchdog reset brcmfmac does on probe and remove preserves the
bit, but a power-on reset clears it: power cycling the slot of a
working system breaks 5 GHz the same way. Read with the driver unbound
after the firmware has run, chipcontrol is 0x01400010 after a reboot
and 0x01000000 after S3 on battery. Bit 22 is lost as well, but
setting bit 4 alone before the firmware is downloaded is enough to
make 5 GHz work again.

A MacBookPro14,2 (subsystem 106b:0157) was reported to behave the same
way, over S3 on AC power as well as on battery: with the driver
unbound, chipcontrol read 0x01400090 after a boot, 0 after S3 and
0x01000000 once the firmware had run again, and setting bit 4 from
user space before loading the driver made 5 GHz work again.

A MacBookPro13,3 (subsystem 106b:015a) was reported to lose the bit as
well, but only over S3 off the charger: with the driver unbound,
chipcontrol read 0x01400090 after a boot and 0 after S3 with the
charger unplugged for some or all of the sleep, but kept bit 4 over S3
on the charger. After S3 on battery, joins failed with status 16, and
setting bit 4 from user space before loading the driver made 5 GHz
work again.

A MacBookPro11,5 (subsystem 106b:0152), on the other hand, boots with
chipcontrol 0x0100000c, bit 4 clear, and 5 GHz works there, so not
every Apple BCM43602 board uses this mode.

Set the bit, if it is clear, before downloading the firmware, but only
for the MacBookPro13,3, MacBookPro14,2 and MacBookPro14,3 subsystem
IDs. Subsystem ID 0x0157 may not be unique to the MacBookPro14,2: it
is also the ID that the module on the MacBookPro14,3 reports after a
reset, until the platform firmware rewrites it to 0x0173, so other
boards with the same module may match too. When the firmware is lost
over a resume, brcmfmac removes and probes the device again, so this
covers S3 as well as a driver reload.

Tested on a MacBookPro14,3 with firmware 7.35.177.61: after power
cycling the slot and after S3 on battery the driver sets the bit and
5 GHz associates again; after a normal boot the bit is already set and
nothing is written. Not tested with this patch on a MacBookPro13,3 or
a MacBookPro14,2.

v3:
- Also set the bit on the MacBookPro13,3 (subsystem 106b:015a), from
  chipcontrol readings reported for that board.
- Add Angel Lindo's Tested-by from v2 on a MacBookPro14,3. His build
  also carried other local patches, one of them keeping the card in D0
  over suspend. His chipcontrol read 0x01000010 after each resume and
  0x01400010 after a boot: bit 22 was lost, so the chip was still
  reset, and bit 4 was set again by this patch. v3 only adds a
  subsystem ID, so nothing changes on that board.

v2:
- Only set the bit on the MacBookPro14,2 and MacBookPro14,3 instead of
  on all Apple BCM43602 boards, since a MacBookPro11,5 boots with the
  bit clear and 5 GHz works there.
- Describe the MacBookPro14,2 and MacBookPro11,5 reports.
- Retested on the MacBookPro14,3 with a slot power cycle. The S3 result
  is from v1, which does the same on this board.
