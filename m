I've since cooked up an experimental patch which resets the Broadcom 4331
wireless card from arch/x86/kernel/early-quirks.c, and another which does
the same from arch/x86/boot/compressed/eboot.c. Both approaches stopped
the spurious interrupts for me and should also stop the DMA'ing.

In the latter case, the machine locked up immediately after resetting the
card. Suspecting that the EFI driver doesn't digest the reset well,
I tried kicking it off the card with DisconnectController() first.
This worked, although it returns EFI_NOT_FOUND, which is strange as that
error isn't defined for DisconnectController() per the spec.

I then tested if DisconnectController() alone is already sufficient
(i.e. without resetting the card by writing to its mmio).
Guess what, it is. So the EFI driver seems to leave the card in a
sane state if it's unloaded.

I then realized that the Simple Network protocol is supported for both
the wireless card as well as the Ethernet card built into my MacBook Pro.
What I'll try next is to iterate over all handles that support that
protocol and just Stop() the interface if it's been brought up by EFI.

Perhaps OS X supports some kind of connection handover from EFI.
That would explain why they leave the card enabled.

Best regards,

Lukas
