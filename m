Ok, whew. :)

My recent grep showed that only virtio-rng set it to a non-zero value.

Agreed.

Gathering conversation about this from a few related threads, I have one
concern.  Apparently there is some confusion in userspace consumers of
/dev/hwrng data as to the quality of it.  Specifically, rngd (spotted by
Stephan Mueller) appears to assume 1bit of entropy per 1 bit read. :-/

So, while moving ath9k-rng to the hwrng framework makes complete sense
internally, it's not so good for existing userspace assumptions.  I'd
think that timeriomem-rng falls in this same category.

In light of this, do you think it's worth the effort (I'm volunteering)
to create a subcategory of hwrng drivers that are 'environemntal' rngs?
They can contribute to the kernel entropy pools, but not to /dev/hwrng.

thx,

Jason.
