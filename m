Given that patches 3, 4 and 5 seem to be a cases of missing error
handling, (3 and 4 in particular seem to be breaking things rather
than fixing them) in my humble opinion, I think this set needs some
work and discussion.

Justin, maybe you'd be better off posting the actual error messages
(split up by subsystem) and letting the lists discuss them, rather
than posting patches which are obviously wrong. (like the ones I've
pointed out)

I'm sure that everyone here is as committed as you are to eliminating
compile warnings and errors and, in my opinion, more good will come
from a healthy discussion of the warnings than maintainers NAKing your
patches out of hand.

Thanks,
