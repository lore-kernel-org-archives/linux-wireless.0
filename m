Sorry, what I was trying to say (but failed) was that bypassing the
hwrng framework and injecting entropy directly the entropy pool was
disatrous.

The fact that this is "most" and not "all" does scare me a little.

As far as I'm concerned *all* hw_random drivers should set quality to
zero, since it should be up to the system administrator.  Perhaps the
one exception is virtio_rng, since if you don't trust the hypvervisor,
the security of the VM is hopeless.  That being said, I have seen
configurations of KVM which use:

	-object rng-random,filename=/dev/urandom,id=rng0 \
	-device virtio-rng-pci,rng=rng0

Which is somewhat non-ideal.  (Try running od -x /dev/random on such a
guest system....)
