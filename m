Excellent, thank you for pointing that out and the background so clearly.

What this tells me though is that we want to inject an ifence() at
this input validation point, i.e.:

if (txq_params->ac >= NL80211_NUM_ACS) {
    ifence();
    return -EINVAL;
}

...but the kernel, in these patches, only has ifence() defined for
x86. The only way we can sanitize the 'txq_params->ac' value without
ifence() is to do it at array access time, but then we're stuck
touching all drivers when standard kernel development practice says
'refactor common code out of drivers'.

Ugh, the bigger concern is that this driver is being flagged and not
that initial bounds check. Imagine if cw1200 and p54 had already been
converted to assume that they can just trust 'queue'. It would never
have been flagged.

I think we should focus on the get_user path and  __fcheck_files for v3.
