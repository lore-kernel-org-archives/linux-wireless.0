Just a question to the Qualcomm devs: You are reading the TEST_DAC
register after switching the PHY to test mode or something. How would
that affect the card's behavior (e.g. if it gets called very
frequently) ? Is it possible to have packet loss or disconnections
because of that ? Also I notice that you read the register twice ?
What's the format of the data you get ?

My approach right now is to get FFT samples from the spectral scan
feature on "background" mode (when the card is scanning) so I get much
more throughput out of that (it's not MMIO, it's dma) and it's more
passive because it's data the card already gathers as part of its
radar detection loop. However I grab the data through debugfs (through
the current interface we have for spectral scan), I'd like to expose
this as a hw rng but I 'm still looking on the proper way of doing it
without having to buffer all this data of put them somewhere until a
consumer comes up. Maybe we could combine the two, provide high
throughput FFT samples (the raw data, without the formatting) when a
spectral scan is happening and when there are no spectral data -and if
your approach doesn't affect the card's operation- we could use that
for backup.
