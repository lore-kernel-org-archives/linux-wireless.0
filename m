Ohh. I didn't realize that networking wireless doesn't fall under netdev.
I thought wireless folks are silent because they are embarrassed
by a function with 17 arguments.

As I was trying to explain in the commit log the single struct
is used in both places, but differences in two
"struct iwl_error_event_table" are carefully matched
field and by field. For two extra fields it was not
possible and they are passed separately as you can see above.
I still believe that tracepoint output is still exactly
the same before and after the patch.
I guess you see the breakage because new fields got
added into one "struct iwl_error_event_table",
but were not added to its evil twin "struct iwl_error_event_table"
with the same name after the patch landed ?
imo wireless folks need to avoid such naming conflicts.
I suggest to isolate common fields into separate base struct and
give two children structs different names.
