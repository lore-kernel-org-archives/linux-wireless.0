Oh man, when I was applying rt2800 patches I did an off by one error
with my patchwork script ('commit 2-12' vs 'commit 1-11') and
accidentally applied this orinoco patch to wireless-drivers-next along
with the 10 rt2800 patches above. And failed to spot that before pushing
the tree :(

As this orinoco patch is pretty important I'll cherry pick it manually
to wireless-drivers also so that it goes to 4.10. This means that the
patch is in both trees, but just with a different commit id.

Sorry for the mess.
