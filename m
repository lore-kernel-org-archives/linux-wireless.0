I don't like this bit either.

Sebastian, how about precomputing the IV and provide them directly
as a hex array?

To test arc4_setup_iv itself, you can add an alg_test_arc4 function
(like alg_test_crc32) that tests IV generation specifically.

Alternatively, just add an alg_test_arc4 that computes the IV
before calling alg_test_skcipher.

Cheers,
