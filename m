Where is the description of the RNG, where is the test implementation?

The issue is that although you may have analyzed it, others are unable to 
measure the quality of the RNG and assess the design as well as the 
implementation of the RNG. This RNG is the only implementation of a hardware 
RNG that per default and without being able to change it at runtime injects 
data into the input_pool where the noise source cannot be audited. Note, even 
other respected RNG noise sources like the Intel RDRAND will not feed into /
dev/random per default in a way that dominates all other noise sources.

I would like to be able to deactivate that noise source to the extent that it 
does not cause /dev/random to unblock. The reason is that your noise source 
starts to dominate all other noise sources.

If you think that this patch is a challenge because your driver starts to 
spin, please help and offer another solution.
