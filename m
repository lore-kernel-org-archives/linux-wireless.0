Subject: [PATCH 6/8] rtlwifi: rtl8188ee: Remove address of Free Software Foundation
Date: Tue,  4 Oct 2016 23:08:08 -0500
Message-Id: <1475640490-5895-7-git-send-email-Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net> (sfid-20161005_060834_187911_1A8A4EA2)

References: <1475640490-5895-1-git-send-email-Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net>
Sender: linux-wireless-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-wireless.vger.kernel.org>

Since this driver was added to the kernel, the checkpatch script was
modified to request that the address of the FSF not be included.
