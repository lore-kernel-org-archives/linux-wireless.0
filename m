While this may be obvious to those who are in the know this mixup is 
easily made outside the crypto domain and especially in the (wireless) 
networking domain (my mind wandered towards the same error path). As 
this series is touching stuff outside crypto it is good to be explicit 
and not use such abbreviations that can be misinterpreted. The article 
Kees referred to is also useful to get into the proper context here and 
at least worth mentioning this or other useful references in the cover 
letter.
