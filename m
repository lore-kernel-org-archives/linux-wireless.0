You guessed corretly, patchwork is here to blame. I sent my "please
rebase" mail earlier in this thread using my custom patchwork client
script (pwcli) which takes the name and address from patchwork.

Andy, this is definitely a bug in patchwork and I have seen this issue
multiple times already. I have understood that it has been fixed in a
recent version but patchwork.kernel.org is still running an old version.
In the original mail Tobin did have the correct From header which can be
checked from the headers in patch page[1]:
