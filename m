Matthew's grub patch puts the wireless card into D3hot, which does not
stop the interrupts. I have tested this. (It may stop the DMA, I cannot
verify that as it doesn't occur on my machine for lack of an access point.)

Calling pci_reset_function() does stop the interrupts. More specifically,
clearing the command register in pci_dev_save_and_disable() does. However
the b43/bcma driver subsequently locks up the machine on module load.
The closed source broadcom-sta driver loads fine. (I'm not even sure it's
worth fixing this anomalous use case in b43/bcma.)

It should be noted that clearing the command register merely cures the
symptom, but not the cause. The wireless core keeps generating interrupts
but they're not coming through because DisINTx is set. I think resetting
the wireless core, as I've done in the patch above, is preferable. Putting
on my tinfoil hat for a moment, this feels like EFI phoning home to Apple
and passing control to the OS with Cupertino still on the line. Seems like
a good idea to hang up that call firmly on boot.

Matthew mentions in his blog post that the DMA occurs in an EFI boot
services data area. According to the spec the OS is free to use that
memory after ExitBootServices(), but a lot of EFI implementations do
not adhere to that rule. Apple is not alone there. That's why the kernel
delays making that memory available to the page allocator, but it doesn't
delay it long enough, i.e. not until PCI header fixups are run, which is
the earliest point where we could reset the wireless core from the PCI
subsystem. (I.e, immediately after BAR scanning.)

More specifically, arch/x86/platform/efi/quirks.c:efi_free_boot_services()
makes EFI boot services memory available to the page allocator and this
is called near the end of init/main.c:start_kernel(). *Afterwards*, the
initcalls are executed via rest_init() -> kernel_init() ->
kernel_init_freeable() -> do_basic_setup() -> do_initcalls(). In particular,
PCI header fixups are executed in the subsys_initcall acpi_init().

Some of the possible solutions are:

(1) Delay efi_free_boot_services() further, e.g. until late_initcall.

(2) Find out exactly which EFI boot services area is used for DMA and
    amend arch/x86/platform/efi/quirks.c:efi_apply_memmap_quirks() to
    assign that area a different type if dmi_match(DMI_SYS_VENDOR,
    "Apple Inc."). That way it's not freed by efi_free_boot_services().
    Add a late_initcall which calls free_bootmem() for that area.

(3) In lieu of a PCI quirk, add an EFI quirk which resets the wireless
    core using efi_pci_io_protocol.mem.write().

(4) It's conceivable that Apple has provided an EFI protocol for the
    wireless card. If it exists, it might allow us to reset it or
    disassociate from the access point, which should stop the DMA.

@Matt Fleming: Do you have a preference or recommendation for either of
these options?

I'm not sure how quickly I can come up with a patch for (3) or how long
it would take to reverse-engineer (4).

Thanks,

Lukas
