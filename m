This patch (and p54, cw1200) look like the same patch?! 
Can you tell me what happend to:

Anyway, I think there's an easy way to solve this: remove the 
"if (queue < ar->hw->queues)" check altogether. It's no longer needed
anymore as the "queue" value is validated long before the driver code
gets called. And from my understanding, this will fix the "In this case
the value of 'ar9170_qmap[queue]' is immediately reused as an index to
the 'ar->edcf' array." gripe your tool complains about.

This is here's a quick test-case for carl9170.:

What does your tool say about this? 

(If necessary, the "queue" value could be even sanitized with a
queue %= ARRAY_SIZE(ar9170_qmap); before the mutex_lock.)
