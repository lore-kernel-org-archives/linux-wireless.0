I'd prefer not to do this because boot services regions can account
for a large amount of memory (multiple gigabytes).

If it is possible to find out which boot services region is the
problematic one, this would be the best solution. If there's any way
to tie it into the PCI quirk, that would be even better so we don't
need to maintain the blacklist in two places.
