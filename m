This is the commit in wireless-drivers:

commit 570b90fa230b8021f51a67fab2245fe8df6fe37d

    orinoco: Use shash instead of ahash for MIC calculations
    
    Eric Biggers pointed out that the orinoco driver pointed
    scatterlists
    at the stack.
    
    Fix it by switching from ahash to shash.  The result should be
    simpler, faster, and more correct.
    
    kvalo: cherry picked from commit
    1fef293b8a9850cfa124a53c1d8878d355010403 as I
    accidentally applied this patch to wireless-drivers-next when I was
    supposed to
    apply this wireless-drivers
