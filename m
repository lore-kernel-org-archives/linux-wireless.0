The link to the check is right there in the earlier post. It's in 
parse_txq_params():
<https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/net/wireless/nl80211.c#L2070>
|	if (txq_params->ac >= NL80211_NUM_ACS)
|		return -EINVAL;

NL80211_NUM_ACS is 4
<http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/v4.15-rc7/source/include/uapi/linux/nl80211.h#L3748>

This check was added ever since mac80211's ieee80211_set_txq_params():
| sdata->tx_conf[params->ac] = p;

For cw1200: the driver just sets the dev->queue to 4.
In carl9170 dev->queues is set to __AR9170_NUM_TXQ and
p54 uses P54_QUEUE_AC_NUM.

Both __AR9170_NUM_TXQ and P54_QUEUE_AC_NUM are 4.
And this is not going to change since all drivers
have to follow mac80211's queue API:
<https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/developers/documentation/mac80211/queues>

Some background:
In the old days (linux 2.6 and early 3.x), the parse_txq_params() function did
not verify the "queue" value. That's why these drivers had to do it.

Here's the relevant code from 2.6.39:
<http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/v2.6.39/source/net/wireless/nl80211.c#L879>
You'll notice that the check is missing there.
Here's mac80211's ieee80211_set_txq_params for reference:
<http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/v2.6.39/source/net/mac80211/cfg.c#L1197>

However over time, the check in the driver has become redundant.

I think it's a very roundabout way :D. In any case the queue %= ...
could also be replaced by:
BUILD_BUG_ON(ARRAY_SIZE(ar9170_qmap) != NL80211_NUM_ACS));
(And the equivalent for p54, cw1200)
