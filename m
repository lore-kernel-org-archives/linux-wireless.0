Nope.  I want to leverage the hwrng framework to facilitate feeding the
*kernel* entropy pools like all the other hwrngs do currently.  The
difference for *environmental* sources is that when userspace read()s
from /dev/hwrng, they will *not* contribute.

If the environmental sources are the only sources, then no /dev/hwrng
should appear.

Agreed.

That's why I propose a change to the hwrng framework to permit noise
sources while not wiring them up to feed /dev/hwrng.  timeriomem-rng
should have the same problem ath9k-rng does.

Basically, if it wasn't designed to be an rng, it shouldn't be wired up
to /dev/hwrng.

thx,

Jason.
