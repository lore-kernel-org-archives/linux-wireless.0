Agreed. But that is a very simplistic view.

Well, I am working with standards bodies like NIST and BSI on RNG 
assessments. They all require that the noise source (pre-whitening, of 
course) pass statistical tests like the AIS20 tests, SP800-22 and similar. If 
you fail, you better have a good argument.

And the only argument that is kind of allowed is that you oversample your 
noise source to seed a DRNG from (i.e. have an entropy to data ratio of 
significantly below 1). And the argument for the oversampling rate is always 
a very interesting discussion. You apply 10/32. In private, I am wondering 
about that ratio, but this should not be discussed here as I hope you have a 
valid argument for that.

As we are talking about the current rngd, we have to consider that it does 
*not* perform an oversampling (yet) as mentioned in the previous emails.

Do not get me wrong on my initial patch: your RNG may provide some entropy. 
But there are quite some folks who want to understand and audit a noise 
source before using it. Your current implementation simply does not allow 
switching the noise source off to feed the input_pool with data that 
increases the entropy estimator (at runtime).

Ciao
Stephan
