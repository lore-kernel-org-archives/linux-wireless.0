Hi Jason, Stephan,

Agree with Jason's point, also  understand Stephan's concern.  The date rate can be roughly estimated by 'cat /dev/random |rngtest -c 1000',  the average speed is 1111.294Kibits/s. I will sent the patch to disable ath9k RNG by default. 

Thanks,
Miaoqing

Ok, so the relevant commit is:

  ed14dc0af7cce ath9k: feeding entropy in kernel from ADC capture

Which refers to a previous commit:

  6301566e0b2d ath9k: export HW random number generator

I think the short-term problem here is the config logic:

config ATH9K_HWRNG
       bool "Random number generator support"
       depends on ATH9K && (HW_RANDOM = y || HW_RANDOM = ATH9K)
       default y

If you have *any* hwrngs you want to use and you have an ath9k card (HW_RANDOM = y and ATH9K != n), you get the behavior Stephan is pointing out.

Short term, we should just default no here.

Well, I don't buy the reasoning listed above for not using the hwrng framework.  Interrupt timings were never designed to be a source of entropy either.  We need to grab it where ever we can find it, especially on embedded systems.  Documentation/hw_random.txt even says:

"""
This data is NOT CHECKED by any fitness tests, and could potentially be bogus (if the hardware is faulty or has been tampered with).
"""

I really don't think there's a problem with adding these sorts of sources under char/hw_random/.  I think the only thing we would be concerned about, other than the already addressed entropy estimation, would be constraining the data rate.

Is ath9k the only wireless card that exposes ADC registers?  What about sound cards?

thx,

Jason.
