Yes, for the SW crypto there, which apparently was never ported to the
crypto functions.

I'm actually surprised it's any of those (actually) mac80211 based
drivers at all, since they ought to just be able to hand the skb to
mac80211 for checking. Not sure what's going on there, but I haven't
looked carefully either.

I think you're probably right, but it's a pretty small function and
architecturally, having those drivers depend on mac80211 but not
actually use any of its "real" functionality is IMHO somewhat confusing,
maybe especially from a Kconfig POV.

Also most drivers already use mac80211 so for those it makes no
difference, but of course there are a number of non-mac80211 drivers
that would get this function.

So I think overall, it still makes more sense in cfg80211 - we've been
treating that as not just nl80211 but also "useful things for drivers"
(for obvious reasons, every WiFi driver must use it), so that'd be the
better place I think.
