It's supposed to work.

Also note there was a bunch of work done to allow swap on NFS: see
a564b8f0 "nfs: enable swap on NFS".

I use NFS mounts over wifi at home.  I may just be odd.  I seem to
recall some bug reports about suspend vs. NFS--were those also on
laptops using NFS?

I wonder if home media centers might do writes over wifi to network
storage?

Googling for "nfs wifi" turns up lots of individuals doing this.

My first impulse is to say that it's probably not perfect but that we
shouldn't make it worse.

But, I don't claim to understand the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM-proliferation issue
you're seeing....
