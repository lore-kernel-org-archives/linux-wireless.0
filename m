Oh yes, these indentation do looks ugly. Thank you for figuring this
out. The tab
width of my editor was set to 4. It should be 8... I will fix these
problems and resend
the patch soon, maybe after receiving a bit more feedback.

Yes, there is one at
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/herbert/cryptodev-2.6.git/
I'm not sure which tree to go either. I'm also not sure about the
beginning of the patch title,
should it be "mac80211:" or "crypto:"?

Options are:
1. This whole patch goes to either mac80211 tree or crypto tree. I
don't know which is better.
2. Make the higher level api only for internal usage in mac80211, i.e.
move the aead_api.c and aead_api.h to net/mac80211, does not export
the symbol. And of course, this will go to the mac80211 tree. I
personally don't want this to be the final solution because I happen
to be writing a loadable kernel module that uses these higher level
api.
3. Maybe split this patch, one for changes in crypto, which will go to
crypto tree, and the other for mac80211 part, which goes to the
mac80211 tree?
