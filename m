hmm. I'm not sure it's the right thing to do, since the macro
is forcing cpu to speculate subsequent load from null instead
of valid pointer.
As Linus said: "
 So that __u._bit masking wasn't masking
 the pointer, it was masking the value that was *read* from the
 pointer, so that you could know that an invalid access returned
 0/NULL, not just the first value in the array.
"
imo just
  return _arr + (_i & _mask);
is enough. No need for union games.
The cpu will speculate the load from _arr[0] if _i is out of bounds
which is the same as if user passed _i == 0 which would have passed
bounds check anyway, so I don't see any data leak from populating
cache with _arr[0] data. In-bounds access can do that just as well
without any speculation.
